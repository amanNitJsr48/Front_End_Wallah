### Q: What is node js in actual?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side.
It’s built on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and is commonly used to create scalable network applications. Example:Node.js as a very smart control room that makes computers do things similarly, like your remote controls the robot!

### Q: What is use strict ?
In JavaScript, "use strict" is a directive that enables strict mode, a way to enforce a more rigorous set of rules for your code, reducing certain common JavaScript errors. When placed at the top of a script or function, strict mode helps prevent mistakes by:

* Disallowing the use of undeclared variables, which reduces accidental global variables.
* Preventing the assignment to non-writable or read-only properties.
* Throwing errors on potentially problematic syntax, like deleting variables or functions directly, which is generally unsupported behavior.*
